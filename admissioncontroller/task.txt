Create a directory /etc/kubernetes/admission and add this configuration file (admission-config.yaml)


----
TASK:

* Enable the ImagePolicyWebhook and NodeRestriction admission controllers on your API server.

* Point the API server to the admission-config.yaml file you just created.

* Ensure the API server restarts successfully (it will fail to deploy new pods because the dummy webhook will block them, which means you configured it correctly!).
