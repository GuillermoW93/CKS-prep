Falco has been installed on Node controlplane and it runs as a service.

It's configured to log to syslog, and this is where the verification for this scenario also looks.

Cause the rule Terminal shell in container to log by:

creating a new Pod of image nginx:alpine
kubectl exec -it POD -- sh into it
check the Falco logs contain a related output


------

Change the Falco output of rule Terminal shell in container to:

include NEW SHELL!!! at the very beginning
include user_id=%user.uid at any position
include repo=%container.image.repository at any position
Cause syslog output again by creating a shell in that Pod.

Verify the syslogs contain the new data.
