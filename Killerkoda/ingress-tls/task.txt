Make sure to have solved the previous Scenario Ingress Create.

The Nginx Ingress Controller has been installed and an Ingress resource configured in Namespace world .

You can reach the application using

curl http://world.universe.mine:30080/europe

Generate a new TLS certificate using:

openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout cert.key -out cert.crt -subj "/CN=world.universe.mine/O=world.universe.mine"

Configure the Ingress to use the new certificate, so that you can call

curl -kv https://world.universe.mine:30443/europe

The curl verbose output should show the new certificate being used instead of the default Ingress one.
