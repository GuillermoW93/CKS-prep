In the first step we'll create a CSR and in the second step we'll manually sign the CSR with the K8s CA file.

The idea here is to create a new "user" that can communicate with K8s.

For this now:

Create a new KEY at /root/60099.key for user named 60099@internal.users
Create a CSR at /root/60099.csr for the KEY

----

Manually sign the CSR with the K8s CA file to generate the CRT at /root/60099.crt .

Create a new context for kubectl named 60099@internal.users which uses this CRT to connect to K8s.
