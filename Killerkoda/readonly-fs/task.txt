Create a Pod named pod-ro in Namespace sun of image busybox:1.32.0 .

Make sure the container keeps running, like using sleep 1d .

The container root filesystem should be read-only.

----

The Deployment web4.0 in Namespace moon doesn't seem to work with readOnlyRootFilesystem .

Add an emptyDir volume to fix this.
