You're asked to verify if the following AppArmor profiles are available on node01 :

docker-default
snap.lxd.lxc
ftpd
tcpdump
Create file /root/profiles.txt on node controlplane . It should contain only these profile names that are available on node01

There is an existing Deployment named spacecow in Namespace moon .

It should be configured to use AppArmor profile docker-default , but something seems wrong.
