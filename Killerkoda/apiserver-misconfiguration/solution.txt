The kube-apiserver (just like other Kubernetes components) live under '/etc/kubernetes/manifests'.

After you apply the change, the kube-apiserver pod will be recreated (static pod). 

- Shortly after, if you run "k get pods" the following error is shown:
The connection to the server 172.30.1.2:6443 was refused - did you specify the right host or port?

That's the first sign something's wrong. 

In order to verify what's wrong run:
- journalctl -u kubelet -f

But to see the logs of the static pod run:
- crictl ps

Look for: "kube-apiserver" container ID and run:
- crictl logs 71b9bb5b60906

You should see something like: "Error while dialing dial tcp: address this-is-very-wrong: missing port in address. Reconnecting..."

Troubleshoot using journalctl:
- journalctl | grep apiserver

or
- tail -f /var/log/syslog | grep apiserver
