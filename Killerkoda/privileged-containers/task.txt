Create a Pod named prime image nginx:alpine .

The container should run as privileged .

Install iptables (apk add iptables ) inside the Pod.

Test the capabilities using iptables -L .

----

There is an existing StatefulSet yaml at /application/sts.yaml .

It should run as privileged but it seems like it cannot be applied.

Fix it and create the StatefulSet.
