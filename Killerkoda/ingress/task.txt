Reference: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/

There are two existing Deployments in Namespace world which should be made accessible via an Ingress.

First: create ClusterIP Services for both Deployments for port 80 . The Services should have the same name as the Deployments.

------

The Nginx Ingress Controller has been installed.

Create a new Ingress resource called world for domain name world.universe.mine . The domain points to the K8s Node IP via /etc/hosts .

The Ingress resource should have two routes pointing to the existing Services:

http://world.universe.mine:30080/europe/

and

http://world.universe.mine:30080/asia/
