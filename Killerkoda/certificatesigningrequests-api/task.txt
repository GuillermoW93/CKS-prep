Here we are first creating a CSR and then we'll sign this using the K8s Api.

The idea here is to create a new "user" that can communicate with K8s.

For this now:

Create a new KEY at /root/60099.key for user named 60099@internal.users
Create a CSR at /root/60099.csr for the KEY

-----

Create a K8s CertificateSigningRequest resource named 60099@internal.users and which sends the /root/60099.csr to the API.

Let the K8s API sign the CertificateSigningRequest.

Download the CRT file to /root/60099.crt .

Create a new context for kubectl named 60099@internal.users which uses this CRT to connect to K8s.
