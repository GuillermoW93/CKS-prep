An ImagePolicyWebhook setup has been half finished, complete it:

Make sure admission_config.json points to correct kubeconfig
Set the allowTTL to 100
All Pod creation should be prevented if the external service is not reachable
The external service will be reachable under https://localhost:1234 in the future. It doesn't exist yet so it shouldn't be able to create any Pods till then
Register the correct admission plugin in the apiserver
