3. Falco Rules

Setup Files:
Assume Falco is installed as a systemd service on your worker node.

The Task:

Create a custom rule in /etc/falco/falco_rules.local.yaml that triggers a WARNING when any process reads the /etc/shadow file.

Reload the Falco service.

Exec into a pod, run cat /etc/shadow, and verify the alert appears in /var/log/syslog or /var/log/falco.log.
