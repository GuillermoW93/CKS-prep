Scenario 4: Control Plane Hardening

Topic: Kube-apiserver anonymous-auth
Context: Kube-bench has reported that anonymous authentication is enabled.

Setup (Simulate the Failure):
If you are running K3s, the API server arguments are passed to the K3s service. If you are using kubeadm, they are in /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml.

The Task:

Locate the configuration for your API server.

Change the flag --anonymous-auth from true (or default) to false.

Ensure the API server restarts successfully.
