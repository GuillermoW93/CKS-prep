Scenario 1: Runtime Security with Falco

Topic: Falco Rule for /dev/mem
Context: You need to detect if any pod tries to access the sensitive /dev/mem device.

Setup (Prerequisites):

Assume Falco is installed (standard for CKS).

If not, install it or just practice the configuration file editing.

The Task:

Update the falco_rules.local.yaml file to include a rule named Detect dev mem access.

The rule should check if fd.name is /dev/mem.

The output should be: "Sensitive file opened (user=%user.name command=%proc.cmdline file=%fd.name)".

Priority should be WARNING.

Trigger the rule by spawning a pod that attempts to read /dev/mem.
