In this lab, you will learn how to use Cilium to implement network security in Kubernetes by configuring pod-to-pod encryption.

You will:

Install and configure Cilium with encryption enabled.
Deploy an NGINX pod and a client pod.
Apply network policies using Cilium to allow secure communication between the pods.
Verify that communication between the pods is encrypted.

-----------------

Deploy an NGINX pod labeled app: nginx that will serve as the application to test encrypted traffic.

image: nginx
replicas: 1
port: 80
Create a service named nginx to expose the NGINX deployment.

port: 80
targetPort: 80
Deploy a client pod named curlpod that will act as a client to test connectivity to the NGINX pod.

image: rapidfort/curl
command: sleep 3600
label: app: curlpod

------------------

Verify connectivity between pods
