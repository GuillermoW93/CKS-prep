First, let's intentionally make the node vulnerable by enabling IP forwarding dynamically. Run this command to set the stage:

sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1

A recent security audit flagged the controlplane node for acting as a router.

Disable IPv4 forwarding on the current node.

Ensure this configuration is applied immediately to the live system.

Ensure the configuration is persistent across node reboots.

----

controlplane:~$ cat /etc/sysctl.conf | grep ip_forward
#net.ipv4.ip_forward=1

controlplane:~$ vi /etc/sysctl.conf 

controlplane:~$ cat /etc/sysctl.conf | grep ip_forward
#net.ipv4.ip_forward=0

-p[FILE], --load[=FILE]
              Load in sysctl settings from the file specified or /etc/sysctl.conf if none given.  Specifying - as filename means reading data from standard input. Using this option will mean  arguments
              to sysctl are files, which are read in the order they are specified.  The file argument may be specified as regular expression.

**By running 'sysctl -p' it reloads default config!**
