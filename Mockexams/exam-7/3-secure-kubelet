Ensure that the Kubelet on the controlplane node:

Disables anonymous authentication.

Delegates authorization decisions to the API server (Webhook).

---

apiVersion: kubelet.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
authentication:
  anonymous:
    enabled: false
  webhook:
    cacheTTL: 0s
    enabled: true
  x509:
    clientCAFile: /etc/kubernetes/pki/ca.crt
authorization:
  mode: Webhook
  webhook:
    cacheAuthorizedTTL: 0s
    cacheUnauthorizedTTL: 0s

Make sure to enable "authentication.anonymous to be **False** the same goes for authorization.mode should be **Webhook**"

By renaming/deleting the default ~/.kube/config file (or unsetting the $KUBECONFIG environment variable) kubectl has no idea how to talk to the API server unless you explicitly feed it the path using --kubeconfig=/path/to/custom/admin.conf.
- e.g. **kubectl --kubeconfig=/path/to/custom/admin.conf get pods**

Always run **sudo systemctl restart kubelet** to apply the changes!
