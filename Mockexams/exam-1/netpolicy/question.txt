A pod called redis-backend has been created in the prod-x12cs namespace. It has been exposed as a service of type ClusterIP. The pod listens on TCP port 6379.

Create a network policy called allow-redis-access to lock down access to this pod only for the following:

Any pod in the same namespace with the label backend=prod-x12cs

All pods in the prod-yx13cs namespace

Ensure that traffic is only allowed on TCP port 6379.

All other incoming connections should be blocked.

Use the existing labels when creating the network policy.
