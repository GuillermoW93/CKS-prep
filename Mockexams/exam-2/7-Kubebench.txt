# Question
You have just read the kube-bench assessment report. Fix the tests that have FAIL status for the worker node configuration.

The kube-bench report gives issues such as (or close to):

"authorisation mode is set as Always allowed"
"Kernel defaults are not protected"
Make changes to the /var/lib/kubelet/config.yaml

# Solution

vi /var/lib/kubelet/config.yaml

change "authorization mode"

authorization:
  mode: Webhook

vi /var/lib/kubelet/config.yaml

protectKernelDefaults: true

now you may exit the kubelet with :wq! and do "systemctl kubelet restart"
