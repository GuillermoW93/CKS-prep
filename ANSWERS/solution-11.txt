11. Validating Binaries with sha512sum

Commands:

Bash
# 1. Generate the hash and save it to a file
sha512sum /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml > apiserver.hash

# 2. Check the file against the hash to ensure it hasn't been tampered with
sha512sum -c apiserver.hash
(If the file was modified, the output will say FAILED.)
